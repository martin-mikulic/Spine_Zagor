# 🦅 Zagor Spine - Live Wallpaper Showcase

Welcome to **Zagor Spine**, an experimental **live wallpaper** project inspired by the classic Italian comic hero **Zagor**.  
This project is part of my learning journey exploring **Spine 2D workflows**, Unity integration, and web deployment.

## 🎯 What is this?

This is a **live wallpaper** running in the browser, built with:

✅ Spine 2D for rigging and animation  
✅ Unity for scene setup and WebGL export  
✅ WebGL player for smooth rendering  

I used this project to practice:

- Rigging layered artwork
- Setting up animation states
- Exporting Spine assets for WebGL
- Connecting Spine animations inside Unity
- Optimizing loading times for web delivery

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- [Spine 2D](http://esotericsoftware.com/) (rigging & animation)
- **Unity Engine** (project integration & WebGL build)
- JavaScript WebGL runtime
- HTML/CSS for layout

## 📚 What I Learned

✨ **Spine Export Workflow**  
How to prepare and export skeletons for the web player.

✨ **Animation Blending**  
Creating smooth idle and motion loops.

✨ **Unity Integration**  
Setting up Spine animations inside Unity and building for WebGL.

✨ **Web Performance**  
Reducing texture sizes and preload times.

## ⚠️ Performance Note

If this demo takes too long to load on your device,  
I’m working on an **alternative version** using only `spine-player` with minimal dependencies:

## ✨ Future Plans

I’m planning to:

- Add interactive states (hover, click)
- Experiment with more Spine skeletons
- Package as a standalone desktop wallpaper

Stay tuned!
